```
-Face API subscription key
```


### Implementation

To check implementation of this lab please refer to the following file in the following path Cognitive-Services-AI-Virtual-Trail-Blazer-Series/Node.js/Day 1/lab01.01-Face Detection.

```
facedetection.js

```


### To check implementation go through following steps :

step 1 : open .env file in the following path "Cognitive-Services-AI-Virtual-Trail-Blazer-Series/Node.js/Day 1/lab01.01-Face Detection/"  and paste Face API subscription key.

Note:Image for testing purpose is set to the following path :"Cognitive-Services-AI-Virtual-Trail-Blazer-Series/Node.js/Day 1/lab01.01-Face Detection/images/"
